* Notes & Lesson Learnt: Google Maps navigated a very bad route, the major part of the road is one lane for two ways. The sign said "Road Closed" but there was a spray painting that said "Not". During the drive, we met two cars driving in the opposite direction. I had to back up the car for few minutes before we finally found a wider place to let them pass.
