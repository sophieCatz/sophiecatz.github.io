# My Trip to Yosemite National Park

<div style="text-align: justify;">
After I graduated from fifth grade in 2025, my family and I decided that for summer break, we would have a road trip from home to Yosemite NP in California in August. We origanally planned to be camping for almost every night, but we ended up mostly sleeping in hotels and inns whenever we couldn't snag a good campsite. This trip was very fun and exciting, so I decided to write a journal about it.

The first day of our road trip also happened to be my dad's 42<sup>nd</sup> birthday. My sister Ella and I wrote "HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DAD!" on a big whiteboard for him. I was really proud of it. We ate breakfast together and sang "happy birthday to you" to our dad. Afterwards, we got ready for our trip. We packed some food items, turned off all the electricity and water, and unplugged all electrical devices.
