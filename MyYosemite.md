# My Trip to Yosemite National Park

After I graduated from fifth grade in 2025, my family and I decided that for summer break, we would have a road trip from home to Yosemite NP in California in August. We origanally planned to be camping for almost every night, but we ended up mostly sleeping in hotels and inns whenever we couldn't snag a good campsite. This trip was very fun and exciting, even when things went wrong. In Oregan, we visited an International Rose Test garden, full of beautiful flowers. My favorite blossom has bright orange petals with pink edges. The next day, we went to Crater Lake National Park, and splashed around happily in the blue-green water. We then visited Tahoe Lake, split between Nevada and California. The water here is crystal-clear (and freezing cold), and my dad, my sister Ella, and I swam in the Nevada side for a while. We camped next to Emerald Bay, on the California side, and then went into Yosemite National Park.
